## Objective

The **Parking Lot USB Exercise** aims to:

1. **Raise Awareness**: Educate employees on the risks of using unknown USB drives and how attackers use them to spread malware or steal sensitive information.
   
2. **Train Employees**: Show how attackers exploit personal and work details to carry out phishing or social engineering attacks.

3. **Test Readiness**: Evaluate how employees handle suspicious USB drives and how well they can report incidents.

4. **Strengthen Security**: Ensure technical protections (e.g., disabling AutoPlay and running antivirus scans) are in place to prevent USB-based threats.

5. **Protect Data**: Safeguard Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive organizational data from unauthorized access.

## Key Controls

- **Awareness Training**: Teach employees how to recognize suspicious USB devices and phishing attempts.
- **Technical Controls**: Disable AutoPlay and implement antivirus software to detect potential threats.
- **Incident Response**: Make sure employees know the proper procedures for reporting suspicious USB drives.

## Outcome

By running this exercise, we aim to minimize security risks, protect sensitive data, and help employees stay vigilant against USB-based threats.
